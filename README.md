# SMS-Spam-Classifier

-Created a mini nlp project to detect and classify spam sms.
-In this project I have used stemming inorder to apply preprocessing and remved all the stopwords 
-Then I have applied Bag Of Vectors algorithm inorder to covert the string to vector
-Later I have trained and tested the data using naive bayes classifier 
-Found out an accuracy of 98% using confusion matrix
